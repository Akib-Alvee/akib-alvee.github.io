I am a Software Engineer at [Samsung Research](https://research.samsung.com/). I've completed my Bachelor degree from Shahjalal University of Science & Technology, SUST.

My research interests lie at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and its collaboration with humans. Broadly, I am interested in understanding the inner workings of generative models and explore how these AI models can enhance human interaction in domains such as extended reality, AI-driven agent simulations, and adaptive learning systems. Additionally, I wish to develop tools that make AI more reliable, interpretable, and accessible for human use, ensuring its seamless integration into various aspects of life.

# Undergraduate Thesis
**Title:** Enhancement and Improvement of Underwater Image Semantics Using Multi-Domain Neural Rendering [Report](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/394407537_Enhancement_and_Improvement_of_Underwater_Image_Semantics_Using_Multi_Domain_Neural_Rendering)
<br>
**Short Description:** Our focus was to identify the common image degradation issues and challenges in underwater environments, and propose a neural network to enhance the underwater images. We set our focus to overcome the low-light, color imbalance and saturation distortions in underwater images. We've used Normalizing Flows combining with multiple color spaces to extract the complex features from raw images. Flow-based model was motivated from OpenAIâ€™s [Glow](https://openai.com/index/glow/) architecture to enhance underwater images, delivering results that matched the quality of state-of-the-art methods and we are planning to publish this work soon. I was fortunate to work with [M. Jahirul Islam, PhD., PEng](https://www.sust.edu/department/cse/faculty/jahir@sust.edu) , [Summit Haque](https://www.sust.edu/department/cse/faculty/summit-cse@sust.edu)  and [Sowmen Das](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sowmen-Das) as my thesis advisors.
