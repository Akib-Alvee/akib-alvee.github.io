I am a Software Engineer at [Samsung Research]([https://research.samsung.com/srbd](https://research.samsung.com/)). I've completed my Bachelor degree from Shahjalal University of Science & Technology, SUST.

My research interests lie at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and its collaboration with humans. Broadly, I am interested in understanding the inner workings of generative models and their diverse applications. My focus is to explore how these AI models can enhance human interaction in domains such as extended reality, AI-driven agent simulations, and adaptive learning systems. Additionally, I wish to develop tools that make AI more reliable, interpretable, and accessible for human use, ensuring its seamless integration into various aspects of life.

# Undergraduate Thesis
**Title:** Enhancement and Improvement of Underwater Image Semantics Using Multi-Domain Neural Rendering<br>
**Short Description:** Our focus was to identify the common image degradation issues and challenges in underwater environments, and propose a neural network to enhance the underwater images. We set our focus to overcome the low-light, color imbalance and saturation distortions in underwater images. We've used Normalizing Flows combining with multiple color spaces to extract the complex features from raw images. Flow-based model was motivated from OpenAIâ€™s [Glow](https://openai.com/index/glow/) architecture to enhance underwater images, delivering results that matched the quality of state-of-the-art methods and we are planning to publish this work soon. I was fortunate to work with [M. Jahirul Islam, PhD., PEng](https://www.sust.edu/department/cse/faculty/jahir@sust.edu) , [Summit Haque](https://www.sust.edu/department/cse/faculty/summit-cse@sust.edu)  and [Sowmen Das](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8RVbUP8AAAAJ&hl=en) as my thesis advisors.
