### Senior Software Engineer at [Samsung R&D Institute Bangladesh](https://research.samsung.com/srbd)

- Worked on the **CameraPlugin**, **Location Summary** and **HomeInsightSettings** module of Samsung SmartThings.
- Designed and implemented a reactive system (using **Rx.NET**) to process REST API responses and store data efficiently in **SQLite DB**, enabling instant app startup with cached data and real-time updates upon remote changes.
- Developed live-streaming, two-way-talk and frame capture pipeline from scratch for **IoT Cameras** using **WebRTC** and **Gstreamer** framework in C++.
- Developed the streaming pipeline from **Push Notification** for IoT CameraDevices with efficient Server Sent Event(SSE) handling during the streaming.
- Worked with **SDP Offer Exchange Protocol**, media stream transmission/receiving through the RTCTransceiver module, and P2P Connection establishment between server and IoT camera devices via WebRTC in C++.
- Implemented **hardware-accelerated rendering** using Hardware Pointer in C++ and utilized
**AppServiceConnection** and **Systray** for efficient IPC communication.
- Diagonised and resolved **deadlock** and **concurrency** issues using multithreading and mutex mechanisms, resulting in an almost **90% reduction of FCs**.
- Optimized app performance and stability by preventing memory leakages and conducting thread, memory, and CPU profiling using tools like **Visual Studio Profiler**.
